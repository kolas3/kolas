Before the legalese starts, here's the translation to plain
english:

<OL>
<LI>Do whatever you want with paintlib. Just don't come running to me
    with a lawyer if something goes wrong.
<LI>If you redistribute paintlib, you should redistribute the whole library
    including documentation and copyright. If that is not possible, you
    must make it clear that you're distributing a changed version. In no
    event may any part of the library be distributed without this
    copyright notice.
<LI>If you use paintlib in your program, you must acknowledge this,
    preferably in the about box and the documentation.
</OL>

<P>
The legalese itself is a derivative work. I modified the LIBPNG copyright
notice. Thanks, guys :-).
