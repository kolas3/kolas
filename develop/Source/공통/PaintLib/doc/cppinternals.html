        page provides an overview of the internal design of paintlib. It is mainly 
        intended for people who want to extend or change the library, for instance 
        by adding custom bitmap classes, new de- or encoders, custom data sources 
        or filter classes. At the right is an UML class diagram describing how 
        the main components of paintlib interact. 
      <P>If you're planning on contributing the code you're writing, please also 
        read the feedback section for things like cvs access etc. 
      <P><b>The Bitmap Classes</b> 
      <p>You can derive custom bitmap classes from PLBmp to define your own storage 
        format for bitmap data. If you're porting paintlib to a different OS, 
        it makes sense to define a new bitmap class which stores data in a format 
        that is native to the OS. There are several pure virtual functions in 
        CBmp which must be defined in a derived class. In addition, there are 
        member variables which must be set correctly. Member pointers must always 
        point to a valid memory location or be NULL. 
      <p> To change the byte ordering within a 32-bit Pixel, you need to change 
        the PL_RGBA_RED, PL_RGBA_GREEN, PL_RGBA_BLUE, and PL_RGBA_ALPHA constants. 
        See the CBmp reference for more information on these constants. 
      <p> <img src="pics/umlbitmaps.gif" width="211" height="168" align="left">Bitmap 
        creation is a two-step process. The first step is the constructor call, 
        and the second step is the call to Create() or the assignment operator. 
        During construction, a derived class creates a small empty bitmap. (This 
        can't be done in the base class because calling virtual functions in a 
        constructor is not allowed. Ask why in comp.lang.c++.moderated and you'll 
        get a lot of good answers ;-). During Create(), the object is initialized 
        to contain a bitmap of a specified size. This two-step process was necessary 
        for older compilers because constructors had no simple way of signalling 
        failure - for instance due to low memory conditions - to the calling program. 
        More importantly, it also makes it possible to call Create() without knowing 
        to which subclass of PLBmp the bitmap actually belongs. Create() and CreateCopy() 
        are implemented in PLBmp itself and call several pure virtual functions 
        that must be implemented: 
      <pre>
  <b>void PLXxxBmp::internalCreate
      ( LONG Width,
        LONG Height,
        WORD BitsPerPixel,
        BOOL bAlphaChannel
      )</b>
  </pre>
      <p> Create an empty bitmap with allocated but uninitialized bits (m_pBits). 
        If necessary, this function also needs to allocate a color table (m_pClrTab). 
        m_pClrTab must be NULL if no color table is allocated. It must call the 
        base class method initLocals() to initialize the member variables. The 
        routine can assume that no memory for members is allocated before it is 
        called. 
      <pre>
  <b>void PLXxxBmp::initLineArray
      ()</b>
  </pre>
      <p> Allocate and initialize the array of pointers to lines (m_pLineArray). 
        This array contains one pointer per line in the bitmap and is returned 
        by GetLineArray(). 
      <pre>
  <b>void PLXxxBmp::freeMembers
      ()</b>
  </pre>
      <p> Free all memory allocated. You should also set the pointers to the memory 
        regions to NULL. 
      <p> In addition, two public functions must be implemented: 
      <pre>
  <b>long PLXxxBmp::GetMemUsed
      ()</b>
  </pre>
      <p> Return the total amount of memory used by the object in bytes. 
      <pre>
  <b>long PLXxxBmp::GetBytesPerLine
      ()</b>
  </pre>
      <p> Return the number of bytes needed per line, including pad bytes if necessary. 
      <p>Bitmap classes also need a copy constructor and an assignment operator. 
        These should be able to copy bitmaps of one class to bitmaps of another 
        class (this can be handy, for instance, if you want to move a DIB to a 
        DDraw surface: DDrawBmp = WinBmp; ). 
      <p> 
      <p>Bitmap classes are meant to be used in a lot of different situations. 
        Use ASSERT statements wherever you can to provide parameter validation. 
      <p> 
      <P><b>Decoder Implementation</b> 
      <P> To decode a file, 3 objects interact: The decoder, the bitmap object, 
        and a data source. In these objects, the work is divided between the base 
        class and a derived class in most cases. As an UML class diagram, the 
        decoder looks like this: 
      <p title="" align="CENTER"> <IMG SRC="pics/umldecoder.gif" WIDTH=478 HEIGHT=315 HSPACE=0 VSPACE=0 BORDER=0 alt=""> 
      <P>The decoder base class PLPicDecoder handles trace levels and provides 
        a standard interface for errors. It also provides routines which read 
        16- and 32- bit integers from the data source in the correct byte order. 
        The main decoding routines MakeBmpFromFile and MakeBmp are in this class. 
        They set up the data source and call DoDecode(), a method which is implemented 
        in each derived class. Most derived classes are decoders for a specific 
        file format. The exception is CAnyPicDecoder, which will be explained 
        later. 
      <P> The DoDecode()-routines handle the actual decoding of the data. In the 
        case of PLPNGDecoder, PLTIFFDecoder, PLGIFDecoder and PLJPEGDecoder, they just call the 
        appropriate routines in the other libraries. In other format-specific 
        decoder classes, the work is done in the class itself, calling base class 
        routines when necessary. The data is placed into the bitmap by calling 
        GetLineArray() and directly writing the lines into the memory regions 
        returned. 
      <P> PLAnyPicDecoder creates a format-specific decoder of each known type 
        on construction. DoDecode() is not implemented in this class. Instead, 
        MakeBmp() is overridden. It auto-detects the file type and calls the MakeBmp() 
        method of the decoder for the file format. 
      <P> If you wish to implement your own decoder, you can use PLTGADecoder as 
        a model. TGA is a simple file format and the code is easy to read. To 
        add auto-detection, you need to add a new decoder member to PLAnyPicDecoder 
        and modify the autodetection code in this class. You also need to handle 
        errors like the existing decoders do (via PLPicDecoder::raiseError()). 
        In particular, if you're interfacing to an existing third-party decoder, 
        you will probably need to handle their errors and call raiseError() whenever 
        the decoder signals an error. 
      <P><B>Custom Data Sources</B> 
      <P> The base class CDataSource handles data which is already in memory. 
        PLFileSource simply opens a file and makes it available as a memory block. 
        If memory-mapped files are available, a mapping is created. If not, all 
        data is read into memory on open. PLResourceSource does the same for windows 
        resources. A new data source class needs to read the data into memory 
        on open and free the memory when Close() is called. 
      <P><b>Encoder Implementation</b> 
      <P>The encoders mirror the decoders... 
      <P><b>Filter Implementation</b> 
      <P>Filters are very simple wrappers around the actual bitmap manipulation 
        functions. To implement a new filter, you need to derive a class from 
        PLFilter, implement a constructor that takes the filters' parameters and 
        override either the Apply() or the ApplyInPlace() function. You can choose 
        which one to implement based on efficiency considerations since the base 
        class implementation will make sure the other one works anyway. 
      <P>Have a look at PLFilterCrop for a simple implementation (or PLFilterFillRect 
        for a cool template-based implementation ;-)).
      <P align="center"><img src="pics/umlfilter.gif" width="508" height="154" align="absmiddle"> 
      <P align="left"><b>Future Directions</b>
      <P align="left">Of course, a lot of paintlib's expansion will use the basic 
        framework outlined above: People will build filters, en- and decoders 
        and data sources/sinks. In addition, there are two refactorings that we 
        can hopefully pull off for version 3. The major one is the addition of 
        pixel classes and templatized bitmap classes. Although that will break 
        backwards compatibility in some places, there is a lot of more-or-less 
        duplicated code that could be thrown away if we had pixel classes. They 
        are also nessesary to support more than the two pixel formats that we 
        currently have (8 and 32 bpp). The second one is that there are still 
        several methods in PLBmp that would be better off in separate filters. 
        If you're thinking of contributing to paintlib, try to make contributions 
        that fit into this general direction. For instance, don't add manipulation 
        functions directly to PLBmp. Write a filter class. 
      <P align="left"><b>Coding Conventions</b> 
      <P align="left">Prefix pointers with p and member variables with m_. Indentation 
        width is 2. Public member functions are uppercase, protected and private 
        ones are lowercase. Braces are on separate lines. Names in the global namespace - 
        classes, defines etc. - begin with PL. File names are all lowercase and have the
        prefix pl.
