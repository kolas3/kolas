      <p> paintlib is a portable C++ class library for image loading, saving and 
        manipulation. Images can be loaded from BMP, GIF, JPEG, PCX, PGM, PICT, 
        PNG, PSD, TGA, TIFF and WMF files and saved in BMP, JPEG, PNG and TIFF 
        formats. Image manipulation can be done either through filters implemented 
        in filter classes or by directly accessing the bitmap bits. Full C++ source 
        is provided. This is library version 2.50, 10/20/02. The newest version 
        of paintlib can be found via <A HREF="http://www.paintlib.de/paintlib/" 
	  TARGET="_top">http://www.paintlib.de/paintlib/</A>. 
      <p> In addition to the C++ library, an ActiveX component to display images 
        in all the formats supported by paintlib is provided. paintX (the paintlib 
        ActiveX control) can be used exactly like a VB picture object would be 
        used. 
      <P> Although there are a few Windows-specific functions (For instance, images 
        can be loaded from windows resource files), the C++ library is portable. 
        A configure script for *nix systems and MS Visual C++ project files are 
        included. In general, the only prerequisite is a C++-compiler with standard 
        C libraries and support for exception handling. (The library also requires 
        support for 32-bit memory addressing, but that shouldn't be a problem 
        these days.)
      <P> paintlib is copyrighted open source software. For details, see the copyright 
        page. In a nutshell: You may use paintlib in any way you wish, providing 
        you preserve the copyright if you redistribute any source. If you distribute 
        a program using paintlib, this must be mentioned in the about box. If 
        you'd like to participate in development, there's a sourceforge project 
        set up with cvs, bug tracking etc. at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/paintlib/" target="_top">http://sourceforge.net/projects/paintlib/</a>. 
      <P> There is a mailing list set up for discussions about paintlib. People 
        on this list also get notified whenever a new version is distributed. 
        You can subscribe on the feedback page. If you have a question about paintlib, 
        your best way of getting help is by asking on the list. If you can't get 
        paintlib to compile, please read the tutorial page before asking for help. 
        Also, <i>don't</i> send me a mail asking me to mail back a compiled version 
        of the library. There is no way I can make sure the compiled version fits 
        your configuration.
