      <P> If you don't have the archive yet, download it. 
      <P>After the download, you'll need to come back to this page - or to the 
        copy of this page in the documentation included with the archive - to 
        read the instructions on how to get paintlib through the compiler. Trial-and-error 
        is a lot more work than reading the relevant sections of the instructions. 
        Trust me. 
      <P><B>Directory Structure</B> 
      <P> After you've unpacked the paintlib archive, you should have created 
        the following directory structure: 
      <PRE>       paintlib-x.x.x
         |--common
         |   |--Filter
         |    --test
         |--config
         |--doc
         |--gnu
         |   |--im2bmp
         |   |--im2jpeg
         |   |--im2png
         |   |--im2tiff
         |   |--libtiff
         |--lib
         |--(testpic)
          --win
             |--libjpeg
             |--libpng
             |--libtiff
             |--libungif
             |--paintlib
             |--paintX
             |--piclook
             |--test
             |--testdec
             |--testdib
             |--TIFFEX
             |--VBPaintX
              --VCPaintX
</PRE>
      <P> All platform-independent source code is in common/. The gnu/ and win/-directory 
        trees contain system-specific files. testpic/ contains a suite of test 
        images in various formats. These pictures are in a separate archive. You 
        don't need to download them to use the library (although it's recommended 
        if you'd like to make sure everything works as intended). doc/ contains 
        the paintlib documentation in html format (You're reading it now), and 
        paintX contains the precompiled paintlib ActiveX control (Also in a separate 
        archive). 
      <P><B>Compiling with Visual C++ under windows</B> 
      <P>For windows compiles, you need to download libungif, libpng, zlib, libtiff 
        and libjpeg and unpack them to paintlib-x.x.x/otherlib/. The download 
        addresses for these packages are given under links in contents. (If you don't 
        need support for one of these file formats, you can compile paintlib without 
        these libraries. See "Omitting file formats" below for details.) 
      <P> Some of the archives default to copying files into directories with 
        version-specific names. For instance, the content of tiff-vx.y/ needs 
        to be placed under otherlib/libtiff/. The easiest way to do this is to 
        unpack the archive to otherlib and then rename tiff-vx.y/ to libtiff/. 
        libungif, libjpeg, libpng and zlib need similar treatment.
      <P> 
      <P> The windows makefiles and projects are maintained for MSVC 6.0 and VS 
        .NET. There are five libraries (paintlib, libpng, libtiff, libjpeg, libungif) 
        and seven test and example programs to be made. Loading the workspace 
        (src\win\paintlib\paintlib.dsw or paintlib.sln, depending on the VC++ 
        Version) into the IDE and doing a batch build of everything should work. 
        Some of the libraries under otherlib generate warnings when they're built 
        under windows. Ignore them. In MSVC 6.0, libpng, libtiff and libjpeg also 
        generate warnings whenever MSVC scans for dependencies. (This is a bug 
        in MSVC: The dependency scan pays no attention to #ifdefs). 
      <P> Run the test programs. test is the main one - it runs automated tests 
        with bitmaps, de- and encoder pairs and filters. Testdec takes a directory 
        as it's command line argument and displays all picture files found. It 
        writes a log to paintlib.log describing success or failure of decoding 
        each file. Testdib demonstrates windows-specific bitmap functions by doing 
        fast blts with transparency. 
      <P> Bernard Delm&eacute;e's PicLook is a complete picture viewer based on 
        paintlib. It implements file loading and saving through paintlib and allows 
        you to try the filters. It also supports printing and print preview, uses 
        palettes, and it shows you a preview in the file open dialog - stuff that 
        many people using paintlib will need. 
      <P> <B>Building with configure</B> 
      <p>If you have a *nix system, try 
      <pre>  ./configure
  make
  make install
  common/test/testpaintlib
</pre>
      <p>in the main directory. The configure script checks for the presence of 
        the libraries that paintlib uses and builds makefiles that fit. (The otherlib/ 
        directory is unused if configure is used). The default prefix directory 
        into which paintlib gets installed is /usr/local. As is usual, this can 
        be changed by calling configure like this (for example): 
      <pre>  ./configure --prefix=/usr
</pre>
      <p>Libraries are copied to $(prefix)/lib, header files are copied to $(prefix)/include/paintlib.</p>
      <p>The main test program is paintlib/common/test/testpaintlib - it runs 
        automated tests with bitmaps, de- and encoder pairs and filters. Debug 
        traces and asserts can be turned on by defining the environment variable 
        CPPFLAGS before calling configure (e.g. export CPPFLAGS=-D_DEBUG in bash).</p>
      <p>paintlib is known to compile and run under Intel Linux, cygwin and Intel 
        FreeBSD systems, gcc 2.9x and 3.1. It currently doesn't run on big-endian 
        systems.<br>
      </p>
      <p><B>Compiling for Other Systems</B> 
      <P> On systems other than the ones mentioned above, you're on your own getting 
        the library through the compiler. I believe someone once got it to work 
        on the Mac, but I've lost contact and don't really know how he did it 
        :-(. The code isn't dependent on many system-specific functions. It does 
        need a C++-compiler which supports exceptions and templates. 
      <P> It shouldn't be too hard for someone who knows his operating system 
        to get paintlib to work. If you succeed, I'd love to know. 
      <P><B>Omitting File Formats</B> 
      <P>(Note that while I tested this feature when it was implemented, I can't 
        really test it exaustively with each re-release. If anything has broken, 
        please let me know.) 
      <P>If you only need a subset of the supported file formats, you can compile 
        paintlib to include only those formats you need. The file config.h (config.vc 
        under windows) defines 
        a symbol for every file format. To remove file format support from paintlib, 
        remove the corresponding defines from config.h and the corresponding source 
        file from the project-/configure-/makefile. If you remove support for 
        PNG, you don't need libpng or zlib anymore. If you remove support for 
        TIFF or JPEG, you don't need libtiff or libjpeg anymore (duh). Removing 
        JPEG support also removes support for JPEG-encoded TIFF and PICT files. 
        Because of this, removing JPEG support without removing TIFF support means 
        that libtiff needs to be reconfigured.
