      <b>Using paintX</b>
      <p>&nbsp; 
      <p> paintX is actually pretty easy to use. It can be used together with 
        any activeX control which exposes a picture propertry (type: IPictureDisp). 
        Basically, you need to call Set <I>object</I>.picture = PicDecoder.LoadPicture(FileName). 
        The decoder does (almost) everything else, if it's installed. 
      <p> Note that paintX is an image <i>decoder</i>, not an image displayer 
        - that's why paintX isn't an activeX control, it's an activeX <i>component</i> 
        (or automation server, or ole automation server - MS keeps changing the 
        names), which means it does not have a user interface and cannot be simply 
        dropped into a dialogbox. 
      <p>The standard error handling methods work with paintX. This means that 
        from Visual Basic, you can use On Error GoTo to specify a routine that 
        will be called when something goes wrong while decoding. 
      <p>
      <b>Installation</b>
      <p>
      To install paintX, you need to download paintX.zip and unpack it to the directory
      you'd like it to be in. WinZip is a good choice for a program to use to unpack it.
      After it's unpacked, paintX needs to be registered with windows. To do this,
      choose "Run..." from the start menu. Type 'c:\windows\system\regsvr32
      c:\paintlib\paintX.dll', replacing the path names with the appropriate
      values for your system. To verify that it's installed, open paintX.xls
      with Excel97 and click on the bitmap. You should get a dialog asking for
      a directory. After you press 'go', all images in that directory should
      get displayed.
      <p>
      <b>Visual Basic - LoadPicture</b>
      <p>
      In this sample, MyImage is the image control that will display the picture.
      The pictures are always delivered in 256-color (8
      bit) or true-color (32 bit) format. Pictures in other formats get promoted to the
      next higher format. For instance, 16-color pictures are delivered as 256-color
      pictures. As an exception, black-and-white tiff images are delivered as 2-color
      pictures. (This exception was coded because of the large number of fax viewers
      which need to display b/w tiffs.)

      End Sub
      </pre>
      <p>
      <b>Visual Basic - LoadResPicture</b>
      <p>
      You can also load a picture from a windows resource using LoadResPicture (ID).
      <pre>
      <FONT color="green">' This sub assumes an Image Control named MyImage is on the form</FONT>
      Sub LoadPictureResTest( ResID as Integer )
        <FONT color="green">' create the decoder</FONT>
        Dim PicDecoder As New PaintX.PictureDecoder

        <FONT color="green">' trap errors</FONT>
        On Error Goto LoadError
            
        <FONT color="green">' load the picture</FONT>
        Set MyImage.Picture = PicDecoder.LoadResPicture(ResID)

        <FONT color="green">' redraw the form</FONT>
        DoEvents
        Repaint

        <FONT color="green">' done!</FONT>
        Exit Sub

        <FONT color="green">' Handle Errors</FONT>
      LoadError:
        MsgBox Hex(Err.Number) & ":" & Err.Description
      End Sub
      </pre>
      <p> LoadResPicture first looks for a resource of type RCDATA. Unfortunatly, 
        the Visual Basic Resource Editor cannot insert RCDATA into a resource 
        file. LoadResPicture will also look for a custom resource of type "PAINTX", 
        if no resource of type RCDATA could be found. 
      <p>
      One problem is that LoadResPicture always looks for the resource in the
      current *.exe. When you run from the IDE, you're not really running your 
      program, you're running VB6.exe. If you call, say PictureDecoder.LoadResPicture(25), 
      PaintX will get resource 25 from VB6.exe, or more likely nothing at all. 
      The app will run correctly once compiled and run as a normal .exe.
       
      <p><b>VBPaintX Demo</b> 
      <p>
       Take a look at the VB example project VBPaintX. It demonstrates the following:
       <UL>
         <LI> loading multiple images with LoadPicture into a MSFlexGrid control 
              (this control is freely distributable and comes with Visual Basic)
         <LI> loading a picture from a resource with LoadResPicture 
              (works only when run as an .exe)
         <LI> error handling with the Err object
       </UL>
       
      <p><b>Using paintX from C++</b> 
      <p>In general, it's easier to just use paintlib directly from Visual C++. 
        But if you're more comfortable using an ActiveX. component, this is how 
        you do it: Create an image control on your form or dialogbox. (Insert 
        activeX control "Microsoft Forms 2.0 Image"). Then add an #import "..\PaintX\paintx.dll" 
        directive just after your #include directives. Now you can just use: 
      <pre>  
      <FONT color="green">// Create the Decoder</FONT>
      PAINTXLib::IPictureDecoderPtr 
        pIPictureDecoder(__uuidof(PAINTXLib::PictureDecoder));


      <FONT color="green">// decode the picture</FONT>
      IPictureDispPtr MyPicture = 
        (IPictureDispPtr)pIPictureDecoder->LoadPicture(_bstr_t("TEST.JPG"));

      <FONT color="green">// set the image</FONT>
      m_Image.SetPicture(MyPicture);
      </pre>
      <p>See the <A HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/welcome/dsmsdn/msdn_drguion020298.htm#drguion020298_p8">
      Dr. Gui Article "Dr. GUI on Components, COM, and ATL", Part 8 </A>
      in the MSDN library for more information about using ActiveX components in VC++ with "smart 
      pointers". 
      <p>
      <p><b>Error handling</b>
      <p>COM error codes are a bit hard to use. Encoded in the HRESULT is the
      severity, the facility and the error code itself (SCODE). 
      <p>
      If the facility is FACILITY_ITF (upper word 0x8004) then we have a
      third-party error code and we have to look at the error source ( VC++:
      _com_error::Source(), VB: Err.Source ) to determine <I>which</I> third-party
      caused the error condition. All PaintX errors have "PAINTX" as the error
      source. See except.h for a complete listing of the decoder errors.
      <pre>
      HRESULT      FACILITY     SCODE   Error
      0x80040001   FACILITY_ITF     1   wrong signature
      0x80040002   FACILITY_ITF     2   format unknown
      0x80040006   FACILITY_ITF     6   format not supported
      0x80040007   FACILITY_ITF     7   internal error of some sort
      0x80040008   FACILITY_ITF     8   unknown file type
      0x80040009   FACILITY_ITF     9   DIB too large
      0x8004000B   FACILITY_ITF    11   end of file
      </pre>
      <p>
      In case you're wondering where errors 3,4,5 and 10 are: these errors are
      mapped to the Win32 error codes:

      <p>
      If the upper word is SEVERITY_ERROR & FACILITY_WIN32 (0x8007), then we have
      an Win32-error.
      <pre>
      HRESULT      FACILITY       SCODE   Error
      0x80070002   FACILITY_WIN32     2   file not found
      0x80070003   FACILITY_WIN32     3   path not found
      0x80070005   FACILITY_WIN32     5   access denied
      0x8007000E   FACILITY_WIN32    14   out of memory
